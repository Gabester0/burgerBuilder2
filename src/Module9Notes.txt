///  Module 9: Lesson 172: Making post requests to Axios ///
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

So we set up our firebase account address as the base URL in the last lectures.  

And we created a file in the root src folder called axios-orders.js.  

So now we want to send our burger order info to our Firebase account.  We will want to 
use a Post Request header.  

With firebase we need to add .json at the end of the item we are sending.  
Firebase stores what is sent to it in json-like structures.  

With firebase you can simply send your post requests to nodeNameOfYourChoice.json.  If 
you don't have an existing node to send to firebase will create it upon receipt of the request.


The actual code consists of a order json object that will include information from 
state.  (Side Note: in production code you want to be sure that your product info is stored
on the server and you calculate all your pricing info and all on the server.  This ensures 
that the usuer isn't manipulating the order data or code to cheat the system.)

And axios.post() in the post call we include '/directoryNodeOfChoice.json' thus telling Axios
where to send it to.  

Then we will include some temporary dummy data for customer.

We pass this object as a second argument in the post request.
